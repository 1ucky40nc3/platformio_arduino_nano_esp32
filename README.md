# platformio_arduino_nano_esp32

An example project to test the PlatformIO IDE in VSCode for Arduino Nano ESP32 programming

## Getting Started

### Install the PlatformIO IDE VSCode Extension

Install the PlatformIO IDE extension from the VSCode extension marketplace (see workspace recommendations). You may be asked to install Python. You may follow the instructions [here](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/faq/install-python.html).

### Initialize the Project

In this example a PlatformIO project has already been created. The project configuration can be inspected in the [platformio.ini](./platformio.ini) file.

The `platformio` (or `pio`) command-line interface should be installed along the the extension. For the local development purposes you need to intialize the  command-line interface. Execute the following commands in the command-line:

```bash
pio project init
```

Note: The command-line has to be a PlatformIO terminal. You can create a new PlatformIO termincal by pressing the `PlatformIO: New Terminal` buttom in the bottom left of your VSCode window.

Run the `pio check` command to do a static code analysis to check if everything is setup correctly.

### Build and Upload the Code to a Arduino Nano ESP32

After installation and initialization you may build and upload the code to your device. Connect the Ardunino Nano ESP32 via USB. Then run the following commands (in a PlatformIO terminal):

```bash
# Check if your device can be detected
pio device list
# Build the code
pio run -e arduino_nano_esp32 -t build
# Upload the build
pio run -e arduino_nano_esp32 -t upload
```
